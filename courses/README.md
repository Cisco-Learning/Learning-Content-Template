# üß¨  Course Definition

Leverage the `template` directory to define the courses that are defined

**Courses** are derived from the [course outline](../course-outline/template/README.md) and expanded upon

# ‚òëÔ∏è  Steps to define Courses 

1. Duplicate the `template` directory for each course in the course outline
   * Label *newly duplicated* directory with a shortened version of the course's title.
   * use the [README.md](./template/README.md) file in the *newly created template* folder to define the course.
2. Leverage the [assets](./template/assets) directory for any course related assets (network topology, png, gif‚Ä¶ etc)
3. Use the [review](./template/review) directory to publish initial versions of the courses to iterate through.
4. Use the [release](./template/release) directory to publish the completed course (videos, instructions, hands on content‚Ä¶ etc)
   **This is where the final version lives and what will be published**

**‚ö†Ô∏è  Do not change the content of the `template` folder for consistency**
