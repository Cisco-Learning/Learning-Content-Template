# üí¢  Lab Definition

Leverage the `template` directory to define labs

**labs** are micro learning content providing learners with hands on experience of what's being taught

## ‚òëÔ∏è Steps to define labs 

1. Duplicate the `template` directory for each use case defined
   * Label *newly duplicated* directory with a shortened version of the use case's title.
   * use the [README.md](./template/README.md) file in the *newly created template* folder to define the use case.
2. Leverage the [assets](./template/assets) directory for any use case related assets (network topology, docker files ..etc)
3. Use the [review](./template/review) directory to publish non-final versions of the labs. This is where *SME Concile*  
4. Use the [release](./template/release) directory to publish the completed use case (videos, instructions, hands on content ..etc) 
**This is where the final version lives and what will be published**

**‚ö†Ô∏è Do not change the content of the `template` folder for consistency**
